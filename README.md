## Hello, I'm Bishmay Barik

I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Economics at Shiv Nadar University, where I focus on macroeconomics and growth theory. My academic journey has deepened my interest in developmental macroeconomics, and I’m particularly drawn to research topics like caste discrimination and other pressing social issues.

I have experience using Stata for data analysis and econometric modeling, and I’m comfortable working with MATLAB for numerical computing and algorithm development. I’m also in the process of building my skills in Python, especially in data science and machine learning applications.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my academic journey by pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics, with a focus on macroeconomic theory. I am passionate about contributing to the existing literature and helping to shape our understanding of complex economic phenomena.

If you share similar research interests or would like to discuss economics—or just about anything else—I’d love to connect! You can reach me at [bishmaykbarik@gmail.com](mailto:bishmaykbarik@gmail.com) or visit my website at [bishmaybarik.github.io](https://bishmaybarik.github.io).
