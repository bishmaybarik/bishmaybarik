## Hey people, I'm Bishmay

I am a Research Associate at the [Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL), Reserve Bank of India](https://www.cafral.org.in/). In the past, I’ve worked as a part-time Research Assistant at QuantEcon and as a Data Science Intern at Development Data Lab. I hold a Master’s degree in Economics from Shiv Nadar University, India.

My interests lie primarily in macroeconomic theory, computational macroeconomics, and exploring the use of AI, LLMs, and neural networks in Economics.

I primarily work with Python and Stata, and I have experience in both applied empirical and development-focused projects in India, as well as theoretical work in various economic domains.

I'm open to opportunities and happy to collaborate on projects. Please feel free to reach out to me at [bishmaykbarik@gmail.com](mailto:bishmaykbarik@gmail.com). To explore more about my interests, research experience, or projects, check out my webpage [here](https://bishmaybarik.github.io/).
