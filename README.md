## Hello, I'm Bishmay Barik

I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Economics at Shiv Nadar University, where I focus on macroeconomics and growth theory. My academic journey has deepened my interest in developmental macroeconomics, and I’m particularly drawn to research topics like caste discrimination and other pressing social issues.

I have a strong technical background with proficiency in Stata for data analysis and econometric modeling, and MATLAB for numerical computing and algorithm development. Lately, I’ve been working on enhancing my skills in Python, particularly in the areas of data science and machine learning.

Outside of my academic and technical pursuits, I enjoy photography. Capturing moments through the lens is a creative outlet for me, allowing me to balance my analytical work with a bit of artistry.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my academic journey by pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics, with a focus on macroeconomic theory. I am passionate about contributing to the existing literature and helping to shape our understanding of complex economic phenomena.
