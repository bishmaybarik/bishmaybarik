## Hello, I'm Bishmay Barik

I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Economics at Shiv Nadar University, with a keen interest in macroeconomics and growth theory. My academic journey has led me to explore various dimensions of developmental macroeconomics, and I’m particularly focused on research related to caste discrimination and other pertinent social issues.

### Research Interests
- **Macroeconomic Theory**: My primary area of interest, where I aspire to deepen my understanding and contribute to the field through future research.
- **Growth Theory**: Exploring the dynamics that drive economic growth and development, especially in emerging economies.
- **Developmental Macroeconomics**: A recent inclination, particularly in understanding how macroeconomic policies impact long-term development.

### Technical Skills
- **Stata**: Proficient in data analysis and econometric modeling.
- **MATLAB**: Experienced in numerical computing and algorithm development.
- **Python**: Currently enhancing my skills, particularly in data science and machine learning applications.

### Hobbies
When I’m not immersed in research or coding, I enjoy photography. Capturing moments through the lens serves as a creative outlet for me.

### Career Aspirations
I am passionate about continuing my academic journey and pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics, with a focus on macroeconomic theory. I aim to contribute to the existing literature and help shape the understanding of complex economic phenomena.
